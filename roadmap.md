To help you grow **CampaignBay** from its current stage to a popular, revenue-generating plugin, here is a 5-sprint roadmap. This plan balances "Free" features to drive installations and "Pro" features to drive sales.

### **Sprint 1: Market Fundamentals (The Stability Phase)**

*Goal: Remove basic objections and provide essential logic.*

* **User Role Restriction \[FREE\]5/3:** Essential for B2B/Wholesale users (e.g., "Wholesale" or "VIP" roles).  
* **Customer-Specific Pricing & Group Discounts \[PRO\]2/5:** Targeted pricing for specific individuals.

* **Purchase History Targeting \[PRO\]:** Reward returning customers based on lifetime spend.  
* **New User One-Time Discount \[FREE\]:** A powerful "lead magnet" feature to help merchants get new users.  
* **Attribute & SKU-Based Discounts \[PRO\]:** Precise targeting for specific variations or stock units.  
* **Discount on Nth Item \[PRO\]:** Advanced sales logic like "Buy 3, get 50% off the 4th".
